# Thinking Less
If i think too hard about what to do, when to do, and how to do it I usually procrastinate and end up not doing the thing and getting distracted

# Externalizing Willpower and Control
- Central Command
	- Calendar
	- To-Dos
	- Quick Notes
	- Notebook for tracking
"If it's not written in my system, it doesn't exist."

# Simple Daily Planning Routine
Under 15 mins
Night before or morning:
- 3 most important things I want to get done that day (MITs)
- Block out specific times in my calendar
- block in breaks and "life maintenance" stuff (meal, commute, shower...)
- Keep it light, not load the entire day and make it cramped. Load at max 60-70% of the day so ADHD or life-chaos doesn't wreck anything

# Time Blocks To Protect Focus
Block tasks in specific times instead of "I'll do it sometime today"
- Focus blocks (Important tasks with high priority. MITs)
- Relax blocks (Life maintenance, commute, shower, chores, easy tasks with less priority)

# Managing Procrastination
ADHD brain resists starting, and if there's anything that contributes to that resistance procrastination is inevitable. Key is making starting tiny and frictionless.
- 2 Minute Rule: Commit to just starting for 2 minutes. Momentum will usually carry.
- Setting up environment in advance: Open textbooks, ready notebooks, set out gym clothes, clear desk end of the day.
- Body Double

# Prioritization: The 4 Quadrants Method
- Urgent + Important: Do it now.
- Important, not urgent: Schedule it.
- Urgent, not important: Delegate and batch later.
- Neither: Delete

# Time Discipline
- Link new habits with existing ones (after breakfast, pack bag)
- Use context and labels in alarms (instead of 8 AM alarm, "Leave for class")
- Set ready alarms (brush teeth and put on shoes 15 mins before leaving)

# Removing The Common Distraction Paths
- Removing or moving stuff away from easy to reach places both digital and physical
- Silencing phone, putting it to another room, deleting apps, blocking sites...
- Keeping "fun stuff" as an intentional, and scheduled rewards

# Tricks
- Visual Cues (checklists, sticky notes, whiteboard, reminders in line of sight)
- Make work and focus rewarding and engaging
- External accountibility: tell someone what you'll do and send picture/proof when done.
