# Derin's PKM Second-Brain Extravaganza

This is my obsidian-vault, personal-knowledge-management system (PKM), second-brain... whatever you want to call it.

## Why?

I am an easily distracted person, I procrastinate a lot, I waste time... I probably have ADHD and many other stuff I don't even know the name of. These stuff sometimes are superpowers and sometimes my greatest curse, I just started to learn, understand and control them. Exactly like how I just started being conscious, probably.

## How I Achieve This?

To keep myself from wasting time and not being in flow, being productive, I'm minimizing distractions and keeping everything simple but powerful. Plugins I have are plugins I use on daily basis, theme I have is Minimal, which is a - you guessed it - a minimal theme that minimizes distractions.

## File Structure / Organization

### Quick Capture

This folder and the notes it contains are ideas, thoughts, a quote I saw, a video I really don't want to forget, an article that piqued my interes... I can give many more examples but I think everyone with couple neurons like me can understand what I mean. Main use of this is to hold on to stuff I'm likely to forget but I actually would like not to. So I can return to it and actually use my brain and refine, research, learn, explore, write, express it deeper for my improvement. Then where I record this thing I refined and put effort into? It goes into my "Permanent Notes".

### Permanent Notes

Like i said, This folder and it's containing notes are notes that I've refined, researched and put effort into. This so I can go back to it, read it from time to time, document my findings and experiences... It's main job is being a store for valuable information that I'd like to keep and turn back to. The topic for the "Quick Capture" and "Permanent Notes" are not strict or defined, they can be about anything and everything.

### Topics

These notes are mostly my study notes for whatever topic I'm studying and would like take notes about. computer science, electronics, physics, math, chemistry, art, literature, history, biology, music, psychology, philosophy...
I don't want to use bunch of folders for every sub-topic in these topics, every concept, etc. so the notes are not organized in folders but rather through tags, links/backlinks, titles and similar kinds of ways of organization.

### Projects

This folder is special because it holds my notes, sketches, Kanban boards, documents about projects I work on. Each and every project is different and these differences can be vast such as one project being about comp. sci. another one about art. So considering this, I am not going to make an effort to put a convention or rule-set for myself to follow for structuring and organizing projects. Each project will have its own folder and that will be it for the *"great-project-structure-rule-book"*.

## What's Next

Anything and everything in this obsidian vault is a subject to change. Like the universe, only absolute truth is everything - without exception - is changing or will change; change is the the universe itself.
Hang around, give me constructive criticism, tell me you like what I'm trying to do, or just watch what I do from the shadows. I'll probably start a blog as well, to gain some publicity and share my thoughts on the *"inter-web"*.
